zzz context is {context}
Before migrating your current {PlatformNameShort} deployment to {OperatorPlatform}, you need to back up your existing data, create k8s secrets for your secret key and postgresql configuration.

[NOTE]
====
If you are migrating both {ControllerName} and {HubName} instances, repeat the steps in xref:create-secret-key-secret_aap-migration[Creating a secret key secret] and xref:create-postresql-secret_aap-migration[Creating a postgresql configuration secret] for both and then proceed to xref:aap-migration[Migrating data to the {PlatformNameShort} Operator].
